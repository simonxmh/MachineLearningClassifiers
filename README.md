To run the code

with the exception of nearestneighbors.py, which was programmed in python2.7
everything else is programmed in python 3.5

The processing file is the data preprocessing code. Other programs are the different classifiers we used. The input output means that the file must be in the filepath where there is a data directory, containing the input data. It will output the processed data in the current directory of code.

therefore run all the files by going into command line and typing
python3 yourfilename.py

for nearestneighbors.py, you can run it by typing
python nearestneighbors.py
